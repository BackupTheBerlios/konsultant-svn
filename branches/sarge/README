Description:
Konsultant is a KDE application for a small team of consultants to
manage clients, tickets, and projects.  A working postgres server is
required for operation.  The design goal is to create both a working
application, but also a simple application framework.  The framework
should be adequate for creating small customized database
applications, but not extravagant/complex enough to require much
overhead in the  initial customization, yet flexible enough to allow
for the obligatory schematic changes that occur when managing a
deployed system.

Installation:
python setup.py install
Konsultant uses a standard distutils setup.
The configuration has to be edited by hand right now.
run konsultant first, then the config file should be in,
.kde/share/config/konsultantrc
You will also need to create the database on the server, although it
is not used at the moment, your will also need to have plpgsql enabled
in the database
createlang -d $dbname plpgsql
I usually do this in template1 so all databases contain it by default.
