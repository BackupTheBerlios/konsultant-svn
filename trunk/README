Description:
Konsultant is a KDE application for a small team of consultants
to manage clients, tickets, and projects.  A working postgres server
is required for operation.  The design goal is to create both a working
application, but also a simple application framework.  The framework
should be adequate for creating small customized database applications,
but not extravagant/complex enough to require much overhead in the 
initial customization, yet flexible enough to allow for the obligatory schematic
changes that occur when managing a deployed system.
